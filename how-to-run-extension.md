# How to run Linkfest extension

Installing the extension permanently involves signing it with Mozilla which I haven't done yet.
[permanent-installation-extension-firefox.md](./prompts/permanent-installation-extension-firefox.md) contains an explanation how to do it but haven't tried this yet.

Right now you have to open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in Firefox and select the `manifest.json` file of the extension in `Load Temporary Add-on` to have access to the extension just during the current session.
